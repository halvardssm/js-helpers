# js-helpers

[Docs](https://doc.deno.land/https/raw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhalvardssm%2Fjs-helpers%2Fmain%2Flib%2Fmod.ts)

This is a repo containing helper methods for js written in ts. Testing is done
via Deno. All modules should be compatible with web standards so that they can
be used both for Deno and Node. The NPM package is generated from Deno code
using [DNT](https://github.com/denoland/dnt).
